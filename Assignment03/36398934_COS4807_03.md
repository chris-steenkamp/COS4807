## Question 1

### 1 (i)

To show that $\exists x\neg(p(x)\rightarrow q(x))\rightarrow\neg(\exists xp(x)\rightarrow \forall xq(x))$ is valid, we need to prove that it is $true$ in all interpretations. To do this we will use proof by contradiction.

Assume that there is some interpretation $\mathscr{I}$ such that the formula is unsatisfiable. i.e. $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists x\neg(p(x)\rightarrow q(x))\rightarrow\neg(\exists xp(x)\rightarrow \forall xq(x)))=F$

1. By the truth values of implication, this means we have $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists x\neg(p(x)\rightarrow q(x)))=T$ and $v_\mathscr{I}( \neg(\exists xp(x)\rightarrow \forall xq(x)))=F$
1. For the antecedent, theorem 7.22 states there must be some assignment $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$ such that $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(\neg(p(x)\rightarrow q(x)))=T$, which, by the truth values of negation, gives us $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(p(x)\rightarrow q(x))=F$.
1. This (again by the truth values of implication) gives us $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(p(x))=T$ and $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(q(x))=F$ for some assignment $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$. This means that we have $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists xp(x)) = T$ (using theorem 7.22).
1. For the consequent, we have $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists xp(x)\rightarrow \forall xq(x))=T$ (negation). But we have already shown $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists xp(x)) = T$, so by implication we have $v_\mathscr{I}(\forall xq(x))=T$.
1. Using theorem 7.22 we then have that for all assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$, $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(q(x))=T$. But we have found at least one assignment $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$ where $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(q(x))=F$ which leads to a contradiction.

Thus our original assumption that there is some $\mathscr{I}$ where the the formula is $false$ is incorrect and so by the truth value of negation the formula must be valid.

### 1 (ii)

We will show that $\exists x\exists yp(x,y)\leftrightarrow\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)$ is unsatisfiable by direct proof. i.e. we will show that the formula is $false$ in all interpretations.

Let $\mathscr{I}$ be an arbitrary interpretation where $\exists x\exists yp(x,y)$ is $true$. Then we have

$$\begin{aligned}
v_\mathscr{I}(\exists x\exists yp(x,y))=T&\iff v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(p(x,y))=T\text{ for some assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$\phantom{cm}(semantics of $\exists$)}\\
&\iff v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(\neg p(x,y)) = F\text{ for some assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$\phantom{4}(truth values of negation)}\\
&\iff\text{it is not the case that }v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(\neg p(x,y))=T\text{ for all assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$}\\
&\iff\text{it is not the case that $v_\mathscr{I}(\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)) = T$ (semantics of $\forall$)}\\
&\iff\text{$v_\mathscr{I}(\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y))=F$}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

In a similar fashion, we again let $\mathscr{I}$ be an arbitrary interpretation where $\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)$ is $true$. We then have

$$\begin{aligned}
v_\mathscr{I}(\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y))=T&\iff\text{$v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(\neg p(x,y))=T$ for all assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$\phantom{cm}(semantics of $\forall$)}\\
&\iff\text{$v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(p(x,y))=F$ for all assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$\phantom{9cm}(truth values of negation of $\forall$)}\\
&\iff\text{it is not the case that $v_{\sigma_\mathscr{I}}(p(x,y))=T$ for some assignments $\sigma_\mathscr{I}$}\\
&\iff\text{it is not the case that $v_\mathscr{I}(\exists x\exists yp(x,y))=T$\phantom{1}(semantics of $\exists$)}\\
&\iff\text{$v_\mathscr{I}(\exists x\exists yp(x,y))=F$}
\end{aligned}
$$

We have thus shown that in an arbitrary interpretation, whenever we have that $\exists x\exists yp(x,y)$ is $true$ then we have that $\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)$ is $false$ and, conversely, whenever $\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)$ is $true$ then $\exists x\exists yp(x,y)$ is $false$. As per the definition of equivalence, this is exacly the case when the truth value of $\exists x\exists yp(x,y)\leftrightarrow\forall x\forall y\neg p(x,y)$ is $false$ and so we have shown that the formula is unsatisfiable.

## Question 2

### 2(i)

With $p \leftarrow strange, q \leftarrow odd, r \leftarrow distinct\_divisors$ we can represent the formula as $$\forall x(p(x) \leftrightarrow \exists y(r(x,y)\land q(y)))$$

The above formula states that for all natural numbers $x$, if $x$ is $strange$ then there is some natural number $y$ which is $odd$ and also distinctly divides $x$. Working from the other direction, it states that for all natural numbers $x$, if there is some natural number $y$ which distinctly divides $x$ and is $odd$, then the number $x$ is strange.

### 2(ii)

Let $\mathscr{I} = (\mathbb{N}, \{odd, even, divides\}, \emptyset)$

Then, assigning $p \leftarrow odd, q \leftarrow even, r \leftarrow divides$ in the formula provided in (i), we have that a number is odd iff it is divisible by some even number, which is not possible. For example, $2k+1 \neq 2n.m$ for any $m,n,k \in \mathbb{N}$ so choosing an odd number, say $45$, we can see that none of its divisors $\{1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45\}$ are even, which makes the forumala false and so it is therefore falsifiable.
